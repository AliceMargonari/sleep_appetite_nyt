  <h1>How Sleep Loss Adds to Weight Gain</h1>
<br>
<p>Losing sleep tends to make people eat more and gain weight, and now a new study suggests that one reason may be the impact that <b> sleep deprivation has on the brain </b>. </p>
<p> The <b> relationship between sleep loss and weight gain is a strong one</b>, borne out in a variety of studies over the years. Large population studies show that both adults and children are more likely to be overweight and obese the less they sleep at night. In smaller, controlled studies, scientists find that when people are allowed to sleep eight hours one night and then half that amount on another, they end up eating more on the days when they’ve had less sleep. </p>

<p>But until now, few if any studies have looked at precisely what goes on in the brain when people are starved of sleep and then faced with food decisions. </p>

<p> The research showed that when the subjects were bleary-eyed and sleep-deprived, they strongly preferred the food choices that were highest in calories, like desserts, chocolate and potato chips. The sleepier they felt, the more they wanted the calorie-rich foods. In fact, the foods they requested when they were sleep deprived added up to about 600 calories more than the foods that they wanted when they were well rested. </p>

<p> At the same time, brain scans showed that on the morning after the subjects’ sleepless night, the heavily caloric foods produced intense activity in an almond-shaped structure called the amygdala, which helps regulate basic emotions as well as our desires for things like food and experiences. That was accompanied by sharply reduced responses in cortical areas of the frontal lobe that regulate decision-making, providing top down control of the amygdala and other primitive brain structures. </p>

<p> Dr. Walker said: "Getting sleep may be the equivalent of rebooting the brain”. “It’s the single <b> most effective thing people can do every day to reset their brain and body health <b/>,” he said. </p>
